# strikethrough-chrome-extension
A chrome extension that allows a user to apply a strikethrough effect on text they've selected.

Clone the repo, then go to the chrome extensions page (<chrome://extensions>) and select developer mode. Then select "load unpacked" and select the repository folder.

Now that you have the extension, pin it to the top right of Chrome, click it once, then highlight some text and select "strikethrough".
